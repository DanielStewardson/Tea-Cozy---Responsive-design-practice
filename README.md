# Tea Cozy - Responsive design practice

CodeCademy Tea Cozy project


Using a design spec supplied by Codecademy, to create a basic, responsive web page.
- Took a few liberties with original spec to try some other things


When VP reduces below 480px:
- Nav bar flex change to clolumn to center, and logo, links size reduced
- Picture and card sizes change to percentage
- Font size reduced
- Remove border radius on containers for better design
- Center footer text
    
Links:
- Apart from internal nav links, links are dead. Just used as practice
